### Level 1: Barn Turkey 🏠
Start your journey in a cozy barn. Eat apples, dodge hay bales, and bulk up for the gauntlet ahead.

Navigate through the twisting corn stalks and find the glowing exit portal to escape! The stalks sway and shift—reach the exit at the top to complete the level.

### Level 3: Pumpkin Pie Boss 🥧
The dreaded Pumpkin Pie boss appears early! Eat apples to chip away at the crust, peck when you're in range, and don't stop dodging pie slices.

### Level 4: Barn Labyrinth 🍂
Find your way through the haybale maze! Navigate the twisting paths between golden hay bales and reach the glowing exit to escape the barnyard.

### Level 5: Hunter Boss 🎯
A relentless hunter tracks you through the treeline. Use hay bales and rocks for cover, bait shots, and gather apples while the rifle reloads.

### Level 6: Forest Labyrinth 🌲
The dark woods twist and turn into a shadowy labyrinth. Navigate between the towering trees and find the glowing exit portal to escape the forest!

### Level 7: Stealth Bomber Boss ✈️
A cloaked B-2 bomber patrols the skies and drops a massive bomb every 20 seconds. The runway is exposed—survive three bombing runs to advance.

### Level 8: Space Labyrinth 🚀
The turkey floats through a cosmic maze in orbit! Navigate the asteroid-filled labyrinth and find the warp gate portal to escape back to Earth.

### Level 9: Northern Lights Boss 🌌
The aurora beast awakens. It hurls aurora orbs, unleashes mega blasts after recharging, and only pineapples fuel your counterattack. Stay mobile!
