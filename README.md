## 📖 Game Levels

### Level 1: Barn Turkey 🏠
Start your journey in a cozy barn. Eat apples, dodge hay bales, and bulk up for the gauntlet ahead.

### Level 2: Corn Maze 🌽
Weave through a living corn labyrinth. The stalks sway closed, so hug the glowing cobs, watch the shifting lanes, and keep moving.

### Level 3: Pumpkin Pie Boss 🥧
The dreaded Pumpkin Pie boss appears early! Eat apples to chip away at the crust, peck when you’re in range, and don’t stop dodging pie slices.

### Level 4: Barn Escape 🍂
Bust out of the barnyard and sprint across the open fields. Leaves swirl, farmers shout, and apples are everywhere—speed is your best friend.

### Level 5: Hunter Boss 🎯
A relentless hunter tracks you through the treeline. Use hay bales and rocks for cover, bait shots, and gather apples while the rifle reloads.

### Level 6: Wood Escape 🌲
The forest thickens into a shadowy wood. Lantern-lit trunks blur past, so thread tight gaps, snag floating fruit, and don’t let the darkness box you in.

### Level 7: Stealth Bomber Boss ✈️
A cloaked B-2 bomber patrols the skies and drops a massive bomb every 20 seconds. The runway is exposed—survive three bombing runs to advance.

### Level 8: Space Escape 🚀
The turkey rockets into orbit on a parade float booster. Drift past hay satellites, dodge orbital debris, and gather zero-g apples before re-entry.

### Level 9: Northern Lights Boss 🌌
The aurora beast awakens. It hurls aurora orbs, unleashes mega blasts after recharging, and only pineapples fuel your counterattack. Stay mobile!

### Level 10: Parade 🎪
Cap off the journey on a moonlit parade runway. Collect float parts, bolt them onto the stage, and trigger confetti bursts as you assemble the victory float.
